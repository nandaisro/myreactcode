          <p>
            COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly through close contact from
            person-to-person. Some people without symptoms may be able to spread
            the virus. We are still learning about how the virus spreads and the
            severity of illness it causes.

              Between people who are in close contact with one another (within
              about 6 feet).
            </li>
            <li>
              Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person
              coughs, sneezes, or talks.
            </li>
            <li>
              These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are
              nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
            </li>
            <li>
              COVID-19 may be spread by people who are not showing symptoms.

          <h1 style={{fontSize:"18px",margintopp:"2%"}}>The virus spreads easily between people</h1>
          <p>
            How easily a virus spreads from person-to-person can vary. Some
            viruses are highly contagious, like measles, while other viruses do
            not spread as easily. Another factor is whether the spread is
            sustained, which means it goes from person-to-person without
            stopping. The virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading very easily
            and sustainably between people. Information from the ongoing
            COVID-19 pandemic suggests that this virus is spreading more
            efficiently than influenza, but not as efficiently as measles, which
            is highly contagious. In general, the more closely a person
            interacts with others and the longer that interaction, the higher
            the risk of COVID-19 spread.
          </p>
          <h1 style={{fontSize:"18px",margintopp:"2%"}}>The virus may be spread in other ways</h1>
          <p>
            It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a
            surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their
            own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes. This is not thought to be
            the main way the virus spreads, but we are still learning more about
            how this virus spreads.

          A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been
                previously identified. The virus causing coronavirus disease
                2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the coronaviruses that
                commonly circulate among humans and cause mild illness, like the
                common cold.

          On February 11, 2020 the World Health Organization announced
                  an official name for the disease that is causing the 2019
                  novel coronavirus outbreak, first identified in Wuhan China.
                  The new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019,
                  abbreviated as COVID-19. In COVID-19, ‘CO’ stands for
                  ‘corona,’ ‘VI’ for ‘virus,’ and ‘D’ for disease. Formerly,
                  this disease was referred to as “2019 novel coronavirus” or
                  “2019-nCoV”.

          The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from

                when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. These

                likely when people are in close contact with one another (within
                about 6 feet). COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and
                sustainably in the community (“community spread”) in many
                affected geographic areas. Community spread means people have
                been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are
                not sure how or where they became infected.

                  It may be possible that people can get COVID-19 by touching a

                  that people can get COVID-19 by drinking water. The COVID-19
                  virus has not been detected in drinking water. Conventional

          It is not yet known whether weather and temperature affect the
                spread of COVID-19. Some other viruses, like those that cause
                the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months
                but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with
                these viruses during other months. There is much more to learn
                about the transmissibility, severity, and other features
                associated with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing.

          Most people who get COVID-19 will be able to recover at home.
                CDC has directions for people who are recovering at home and
                their caregivers, including:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Stay home when you are sick, except to get medical care.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Use a separate room and bathroom for sick household members

                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20
                    seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or
                    sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or
                    preparing food.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If soap and water are not readily available, use an
                    alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.
                    Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly
                    dirty.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Provide your sick household member with clean disposable
                    facemasks to wear at home, if available, to help prevent
                    spreading COVID-19 to others.

                  <li>
